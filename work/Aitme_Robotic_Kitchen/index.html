          The Aitme Robotic Kitchen is a fully automated robot kitchen that prepares various dishes such as pasta,
          risotto, bowls or salads from fresh ingredients completely independently. It is a self-contained,
          self-sufficient system with two robots and several cooking pots working in parallel that can prepare around 60
          dishes per hour. You can order either directly via a touchscreen or conveniently in advance via the app.
          <br>
          <br>
          The appearance of the Aitme Robotic Kitchen is based on the mix of a classic food truck and an Airstream food
          truck. The system is characterized by its hygienic design as it is easy to clean and thoroughly disinfected.
          It is made entirely of stainless steel as the material is safe for the food sector.

          The machine is made entirely of stainless steel, which is easy to clean and disinfect. The material is
          harmless for the food sector and, in addition to constructive solutions, contributes to the hygienic design of
          the system. The large glass pane takes away the anonymity of the robot kitchen. The guest can watch as the
          dish they have ordered is prepared and served via a serving tray after just a few minutes.
          <br>
          <br>
          Aitme's robot kitchen only requires eight square meters of space and requires only one water and one power
          connection. The compactness of the system and the fact that it can be dismantled into smaller modules that fit
          through standard entrance doors allows it to be installed in small company canteens or break rooms. But larger
          company restaurants and government canteens also benefit from the efficiency of the Robotic Kitchen, because
          it is an important component in being able to offer high-quality, fresh and balanced nutrition at any time,
          including off-peak and night times.
